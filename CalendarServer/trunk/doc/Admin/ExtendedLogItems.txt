Calendar Server extends the Apache log file format it uses by:

 * Adding a "sub-method" to the HTTP method field.
 * Adding key-value pairs at the end of log lines.

The sub-method is adding by appending a "." followed by the name of
the sub-method to the original HTTP request method.  This is used to
clarify what operation is going on for HTTP methods that are commonly
used to tunnel other operations, such as POST and REPORT.  For
example, CalDAV uses POST to for free/busy lookups, and there are many
types of REPORTs.

Key-value pairs are used to provide additional details about the
request.  They are added to the end of the line as enw fields in the
form key=value.

These keys are always emitted:

 * i - the port number of the server instance emitting the log entry.

 * t - the amount of time spent processing the request (in
   milliseconds).

 * or - the number of outstanding requests enqueued for the server
   instance emitting the log entry.

Keys that may be emitted depending on the client request and server
response include:

 * rcount - the number of resources specified in a MULTIGET request.

 * responses - the number of responses included in a multi-status
   response to a PROPFIND request or a CalDAV calendar-query request.

 * recipients - the number of recipients in a CalDAV scheduling
   request via POST.

 * itip.requests - the number of attendees in an iMIP scheduling
   request.

 * itip.refreshes - the number of attendee refreshes completed after
   an iMIP refresh request.

 * itip.reply - "reply" or "cancel" if...???
