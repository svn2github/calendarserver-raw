Apache-style Access Log Extensions
==================================

Calendar Server extends the Apache log file format it uses by:

 * Adding a "sub-method" to the HTTP method field.
 * Adding key-value pairs at the end of log lines.

The sub-method is adding by appending the name of the sub-method in
parentheses to the original HTTP request method.  This is used to
clarify what operation is going on for HTTP methods that are commonly
used to tunnel other operations, such as ``POST`` and ``REPORT``.  For
example, CalDAV uses ``POST`` for free/busy lookups, and ``REPORT``
can be used to make any sort of query.

Key-value pairs are used to provide additional details about the
request.  They are added to the end of the line as new fields in the
form ``key=value``.

These keys are always emitted:

  ``i``

    the port number of the server instance emitting the log

  ``t``

    the amount of time spent processing the request (in milliseconds).

  ``or``

    the number of outstanding requests enqueued for the server
    instance emitting the log entry.

Keys that may be emitted depending on the client request and server
response include:

  ``rcount``

    the number of resources specified in a ``MULTIGET`` request.

  ``responses``

    the number of responses included in a ``multi-status`` response to
    a ``PROPFIND`` request or a CalDAV ``calendar-query`` request.

  ``recipients``

    the number of recipients in a CalDAV scheduling request via
    ``POST`` (which are typically only free/busy requests).

  ``itip.requests``

    the number of attendees in a scheduling operation triggered by an
    Organizer.

  ``itip.refreshes``

    the number of attendee refreshes completed after a scheduling
    operation.

  ``itip.reply``

    Either ``reply`` or ``cancel`` depending on...???

In the following example, we see a ``CalDAV:calendar-multiget``
``REPORT`` for 32 resources in a user's calendar, which was handled by
instance ``8459`` in 183.0ms, with one outstanding request (the one
being logged):
