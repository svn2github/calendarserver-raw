        Data store objects can have an associated Notifier object which is
        responsible for the actual communication with the outside world.
        Clients determine what notification service to subscribe to by
        querying the server for various DAV properties.  These properties
        include unique IDs from each resource, and the source of truth for
        these IDs is the data store.  This method returns the notification
        related ID for a given data store object.

        Sharing introduces the need for a data store object to have multiple
        notifier IDs because a subscriber sees the ID for the particular
        collection being shared while the sharer sees the ID of the parent
        home.  Therefore there is a label parameter to identify which ID is
        being requested: "default" (what a sharer sees), or "collection"
        for the collection itself (what a subscriber sees).

        <hostname> is the name of the calendar server
        <notifierID> is a unique string representing the resource

        This method builds this string based on pubsub configuration
        that was passed to the NotifierFactory, and it also attempts
        to create and configure the node in the pubsub server.  If that
        fails, a value of None will be returned. This is used when a client
        requests push-related DAV properties.
