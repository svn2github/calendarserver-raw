        Data store objects can have an associated Notifier object which is

        Clients determine what notification service to subscribe to by
        querying the server for various DAV properties.  These properties
        include unique IDs from each resource, and the source of truth for
        these IDs is the data store.  This method returns the notification
        related ID for a given data store object.

        Sharing introduces the need for a data store object to have multiple
        notifier IDs because a subscriber sees the ID for the particular
        collection being shared while the sharer sees the ID of the parent
        home.  Therefore there is a label parameter to identify which ID is
        being requested: "default" (what a sharer sees), or "collection"
        for the collection itself (what a subscriber sees).
