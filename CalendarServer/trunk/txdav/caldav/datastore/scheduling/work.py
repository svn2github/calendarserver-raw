    The associated work item table is SCHEDULE_REFRESH_WORK.

    This work item is used to trigger an iTIP refresh of attendees. This happens when one attendee
    replies to an invite, and we want to have the others attendees see that change - eventually. We
    are going to use the SCHEDULE_REFRESH_ATTENDEES table to track the list of attendees needing
    a refresh for each calendar object resource (identified by the organizer's resource-id for that
    calendar object). We want to do refreshes in batches with a configurable time between each batch.

    The tricky part here is handling race conditions, where two or more attendee replies happen at the
    same time, or happen whilst a previously queued refresh has started batch processing. Here is how
    we will handle that:

    1) Each time a refresh is needed we will add all attendees to the SCHEDULE_REFRESH_ATTENDEES table.
    This will happen even if those attendees are currently listed in that table. We ensure the table is
    not unique wrt to attendees - this means that two simultaneous refreshes can happily insert the
    same set of attendees without running into unique constraints and thus without having to use
    savepoints to cope with that. This will mean duplicate attendees listed in the table, but we take
    care of that when executing the work item, as per the next point. We also always schedule a new work
    item for the refresh - even if others are present. The work items are coalesced when executed, with
    the actual refresh only running at the time of the latest enqueued item. That ensures there is always
    a pause between a change that causes a refresh and then next actual refresh batch being done, giving
    some breathing space in case rapid changes are happening to the iCalendar data.

    2) When a work item is triggered we get the set of unique attendees needing a refresh from the
    SCHEDULE_REFRESH_ATTENDEES table. We split out a batch of those to actually refresh - with the
    others being left in the table as-is. We then remove the batch of attendees from the
    SCHEDULE_REFRESH_ATTENDEES table - this will remove duplicates. The refresh is then done and a
    new work item scheduled to do the next batch. We only stop rescheduling work items when nothing
    is found during the initial query. Note that if any refresh is done we will always reschedule work
    even if we know none remain. That should handle the case where a new refresh occurs whilst
    processing the last batch from a previous refresh.

    Hopefully the above methodology will deal with concurrency issues, preventing any excessive locking
    or failed inserts etc.
