# It's entirely ridiculous that we have to *build* our C dependencies in order
# to simply download our Python dependencies, but in order to calculate
# dependencies, setuptools needs to basically run "setup.py egg_info", and
# some packages require the C dependencies in order to do this, and several
# even build stuff in this case.
#
# So the caclulation work here is enormous when it should be rather simple.
#
# Then, of course, we throw most of that work away, because we don't want build
# products here, just the source files.
#
# Oy.
