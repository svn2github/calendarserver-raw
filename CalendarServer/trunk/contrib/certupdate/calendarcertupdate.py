# CertUpdate script for calendar / addresbook service.
#
# This script will be called with the path to the cert file in
# /etc/certificates and also the keychain persistent reference if
# we have one available. For the remove command, the handler
# returns 0 = don't care, 1 = please keep, 2 = an error occurred.
# For the replace command the handler returns
# 0 = don't care/ cert replaced, 2 = an error occurred.
