Tests for L{txdav.caldav.datastore.scheduling}.

The aforementioned module is intended to eventually support implicit
scheduling; however, it does not currently.  The interim purpose of this module
and accompanying tests is to effectively test the interface specifications to
make sure that the common tests don't require anything I{not} specified in the
interface, so that dynamic proxies specified with a tool like
C{proxyForInterface} can be used to implement features such as implicit
scheduling or data caching as middleware in the data-store layer.
