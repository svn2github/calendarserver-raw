        calendar home based on that information, then sets the sharee's UID on
        that calendar, the main effect of which is to change the per-user uid
        of the properties for that calendar object.

        What I{should} be happening is that the calendars
        just show up in the sharee's calendar home, and have a separate methods
        to determine the sharee's and the owner's calendar homes, so the front
