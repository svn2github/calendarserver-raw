    # libclntsh's reading of environment variables.  It doesn't matter what the
    # database language is; the database may contain iCalendar data in many
    # languages, but we MUST set NLS_LANG to a value that includes an encoding
    # (character set?) that includes all of Unicode, so that the connection can
    # encode and decode any valid unicode data.  This is not to encode and
    # decode bytes, but rather, to faithfully relay Python unicode strings to
    # the database.  The default connection encoding is US-ASCII, which is
    # definitely no good.  NLS_LANG needs to be set before the first call to
    # connect(), not actually before the module gets imported, but this is as
    # good a place as any.  I am explicitly setting this rather than inheriting
    # it, because it's not a configuration value in the sense that multiple
    # values may possibly be correct; _only_ UTF-8 is ever correct to work with
    # our software, and other values will fail CalDAVTester.  (The state is,
