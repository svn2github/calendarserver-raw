Internet-Draft               SRV for CalDAV                 October 2009


1.  Introduction

   [RFC2782] defines a DNS-based service discovery protocol that has
   been widely adopted as a means of locating particular services within
   a local area network and beyond, using SRV RR records.

   [RFC4791] defines the CalDAV Calendar Access protocol, based on HTTP
   [RFC2616], for accessing calendar data stored on a server.  CalDAV
   clients need to be able to discover appropriate CalDAV servers within
   their local area network and at other domains, e.g., to minimize the
   need for end users to know specific details such as hostname and port
   for their servers.

   [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-carddav] defines the CardDAV vCard Access protocol
   based on HTTP [RFC2616], for accessing contact data stored on a
   server.  As with CalDAV, clients also need to be able to discover
   CardDAV servers.

   This specification defines new SRV service types for the CalDAV
   protocol, and gives an example of how clients can use this together
   with other protocol features to enable simple client configuration.
   SRV service types for CardDAV are already defined in Section 11 of
   [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-carddav].

   Another issue with CalDAV or CardDAV service discovery is that the
   service may not be located at the "root" URI of the HTTP server
   hosting it.  For example, if CalDAV is implemented as a "servlet" in
   a web server "container", the servlet "context path" might be
   "/caldav/".  So the URI for the CalDAV service would be, e.g.,
   "http://caldav.example.com/caldav/" rather than
   "http://caldav.example.com/".  SRV records by themselves only provide
   a hostname and port for the service, not a path.  Since the client
   "bootstrapping" process requires initial access to the "context path"
   of the service, there needs to be a simple way for clients to also
   discover what that path is.

   This specification makes use of the "well known URI" feature
   [I-D.nottingham-site-meta] of HTTP servers to provide a well known
   URI for CalDAV or CardDAV services that clients can make use of.  The
   well known URI will point to a resource on the server that might be
   the actual "context path" of the CalDAV or CardDAV service, or it
   might simply be a "stub" resource that provides a redirect to the
   actual "context path".

   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  CalDAV SRV Service Types

   This specification adds two service types for use with SRV records:

   caldav:  Identifies a CalDAV server that uses HTTP without transport
      layer security ([RFC2818]).

   caldavs:  Identifies a CalDAV server that uses HTTP with transport
      layer security ([RFC2818]).

   Clients SHOULD honor "TTL", "Priority" and "Weight" values in the SRV
   records, as described by [RFC2782].

   Example: service record for server without transport layer security

       _caldav._tcp     SRV 0 1 80 calendar.example.com.

   Example: service record for server with transport layer security

       _caldavs._tcp    SRV 0 1 443 calendar.example.com.

4.  CalDAV and CardDAV Service Well-Known URI

   Two "well-known" URIs are registered by this specification for CalDAV
   and CardDAV services, "caldav" and "carddav" respectively (see
   Section 7).  These URIs point to a resource that the client can use
   as the "context path" for the service they are trying to use.  The
   actual service could be located at that specific path.  Alternatively
   the server MAY redirect HTTP requests for that resource (using the
   "301 Moved Permanently" status response) to the actual "context
   path".  Clients MUST handle HTTP redirects on the well-known URI.

4.1.  Example: well-known URI as context path

   A CalDAV server has a "context path" that is the same as the well-
   known URI, so the client will use "/.well-known/caldav" as the path
   for its "bootstrapping" process after it has first found the hostname
   and port via an SRV lookup.

4.2.  Example: well-known URI redirects to actual context path

   A CalDAV server has a "context path" that is "/servlet/caldav".  The
   client will use "/.well-known/caldav" as the path for its
   "bootstrapping" process after it has first found the hostname and
   port via an SRV lookup.  When the client makes its initial HTTP
   request against "/.well-known/caldav", the server would issue an HTTP

Internet-Draft               SRV for CalDAV                 October 2009


   301 redirect response with a Location response header using the path
   "/servlet/caldav".  The client would then "follow" this redirect to
   the new resource and continue making HTTP requests there to complete
   its "bootstrapping" process.

5.  Client "Bootstrapping" Guidelines

   This section describes a procedure that CalDAV or CardDAV clients MAY
   use to do their initial configuration based on minimal user input.

   For a CalDAV server, minimal input from a user would consist of a
   calendar user address.  A calendar user address is defined by
   iCalendar [RFC5545] to be a URI [RFC3986].  Provided a user
   identifier and a domain name can be extracted from the URI, this
   simple "bootstrap" configuration can be done.

   If the calendar user address is a "mailto:" [RFC2368] URI, the
   "mailbox" portion of the URI is examined and the "local-part" and
   "domain" portions extracted.  The "local-part" is used for the user
   identifier and the "domain" is used as the service domain.

   If the calendar user address is an "http:" [RFC2616] or "https:"
   [RFC2818] URI, the "userinfo" and "host" portion of the URI is
   extracted.  The "userinfo" is used for the user identifier and the
   "host" is used as the service domain.

   For a CardDAV server, minimal input from a user would consist of
   their email address [RFC5322] for the domain where the CardDAV
   service is hosted.  The "mailbox" portion of the email address is
   examined and the "local-part" and "domain" portions extracted.  The
   "local-part" is used for the user identifier and the "domain" is used
   as the service domain.

   Once the user identifier and service domain have been extracted, the
   following is done:

   1.  An SRV lookup for _caldavs._tcp (for CalDAV) or _carddavs._tcp
       (for CardDAV) is done against the extracted service domain.

   2.  If no result is found for that, the client can try _caldav._tcp
       (for CalDAV) or _carddav._tcp (for CardDAV) provided non-SSL
       connections are appropriate.

   3.  If an SRV record is returned the client extracts the server host
       name and port number.

   4.  The client does an authenticated "PROPFIND" [RFC4791] request
       using the user identifier, host name and port number and a

Internet-Draft               SRV for CalDAV                 October 2009


       request URI of "/.well-known/caldav" (for CalDAV) or "/.well-
       known/carddav" (for CardDAV).  The body of the request should
       include the DAV:current-user-principal [RFC5397] property as one
       of the properties to return.  Note that clients MUST properly
       handle HTTP redirect responses for the request.

   5.  If the server returns a 404 Not Found HTTP status response to the
       request on the well-known URI, clients MAY try repeating the
       request on the "root" URI "/".

   6.  If the DAV:current-user-principal property is returned on the
       initial request, the client uses that value for the principal-URI
       of the authenticated user.  With that, it can do a "PROPFIND" on
       the principal-URI and discover additional properties for
       configuration.

   7.  If the DAV:current-user-principal property is not returned, then
       the client will need to request the principal-URI path from the
       user in order to continue with configuration.

6.  Security Considerations

   Clients that support transport layer security as defined by [RFC2818]
   SHOULD try the "caldavs" or "carddavs" services first before trying
   the "caldav" or "carddav" services respectively.  If a user has
   explicitly requested a connection with transport layer security, the
   client MUST NOT use any service information returned for the "caldav"
   or "carddav" services.  Clients MUST follow the certificate
   verification process specified in
   [I-D.saintandre-tls-server-id-check].

   A malicious attacker with access to the DNS server data can
   potentially cause clients to connect to any server chosen by the
   attacker.  In the absence of a secure DNS option, clients SHOULD
   check that the host name returned in the SRV record matches the
   original service domain that was queried.  If the host is not in the
   queried domain, clients SHOULD verify with the user that the SRV host
   name is suitable for use before executing any CalDAV or CardDAV
   requests against the host.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines two "well-known" URIs using the registration
   procedure and template from Section 5.1 of
   [I-D.nottingham-site-meta].
