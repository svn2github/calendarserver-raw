Abstract

   This document specifies a new iCalendar calendar component that
   allows the publication of available and unavailable time periods
   associated with a calendar user.  This component can be used in
   standard iCalendar free-busy lookups, including iTIP free-busy
   requests, to generate repeating blocks of available or busy time with
   exceptions as needed.

   This document also defines extensions to CalDAV calendar-access and
   calendar-auto-schedule which specify how this new calendar component
   should be used when doing free-busy time evaluation in CalDAV.

Internet-Draft            Calendar Availability               April 2011


1.  Introduction

   Often calendar users have regular periods of time when they are
   either available to be scheduled or always unavailable.  For example,
   an office worker will often wish to only appear free to their work
   colleagues during normal 'office hours' (e.g., Monday through Friday,
   9 am through 5 pm).  Or, a university professor may only be available
   to students during a set period of time (e.g., Thursday afternoons, 2
   pm through 5 pm during term time only).  Ideally users should be able
   to specify such periods directly via their calendar user agent, and
   have them automatically considered as part of the normal free-busy
   lookup for that user.  In addition it should be possible to present
   different periods of available time depending on which user is making
   the request.

   iCalendar [RFC5545] defines a "VFREEBUSY" component that can be used
   to represent fixed busy time periods, but it does does not provide a
   way to specify a repeating period of available or unavailable time.
   Since repeating patterns are often the case, "VFREEBUSY" components
   are not sufficient to solve this problem.

   This specification defines a new type of iCalendar calendar component
   that can be used to publish user availability.

   CalDAV [RFC4791] provides a way for calendar users to access and
   manage calendar data and exchange this data via scheduling
   operations.  As part of this the, CalDAV calendar-access [RFC4791]
   feature provides a CALDAV:free-busy-query REPORT that returns free-
   busy information for a calendar collection or hierarchy of calendar
   collections.  Also, the CalDAV calendar-auto-schedule
   [I-D.desruisseaux-caldav-sched] feature allows free-busy information
   for a calendar user to be determined.  Both of these operations
   involve examining user calendars for events that 'block time', with
   the blocked out periods being returned in a "VFREEBUSY" component.

   This specification extends the CalDAV calendar-access and CalDAV
   calendar-auto-schedule features to allow the new iCalendar
   availability components to be stored and manipulated, and to allow
   free-busy lookups to use the information from any such components, if
   present.

   When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" and
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav" are referenced in this document
   outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:" and
   "CALDAV:" will be prefixed to the element type names respectively.


3.  iCalendar Extensions

   This specification adds a new "VAVAILABILITY" calendar component to
   iCalendar.  The "VAVAILABILITY" component is itself a container for
   new "AVAILABLE" sub-components.

   The purpose of the "VAVAILABILITY" calendar component is to provide a
   grouping of available time information over a specific range of time.
   Within that there are specific time ranges that are marked as
   available via a set of "AVAILABLE" calendar sub-components.  Together
   these can be used to specify available time that can repeat over set
   periods of time, and which can vary over time.

3.1.  Availability Component

   Component Name:  VAVAILABILITY

   Purpose:  Provide a grouping of component properties that describe
      the availability associated with a calendar user.

   Format Definition:  A "VAVAILABILITY" calendar component is defined
      by the following notation:

          availabilityc  = "BEGIN" ":" "VAVAILABILITY" CRLF
                           availabilityprop *availablec
                           "END" ":" "VAVAILABILITY" CRLF

          availabilityprop  = *(
                            ;
                            ; the following are REQUIRED,
                            ; but MUST NOT occur more than once
                            ;
                            dtstamp / uid
                            ;
                            ; the following are OPTIONAL,
                            ; but MUST NOT occur more than once
                            ;
                            busytype / class / created / description /

   Description:  A "VAVAILABILITY" component indicates a period of time
      within which availability information is provided.  A
      "VAVAILABILITY" component can specify a start time and an end time
      or duration.  If "DTSTART" is not present, then the start time is
      unbounded.  If "DTEND" or "DURATION" are not present, then the end
      time is unbounded.  Within the specified time period, availability
      defaults to a free-busy type of "BUSY-UNAVAILABLE", except for any
      time periods corresponding to "AVAILABLE" sub-components.

      "AVAILABLE" sub-components are used to indicate periods of free
      time within the time range of the enclosing "VAVAILABILITY"
      component.  "AVAILABLE" sub-components MAY include recurrence
      properties to specify recurring periods of time, which may be
      overridden using normal recurrence behavior (i.e., use of the
      "RECURRENCE-ID" property).

      If specified, the "DTSTART" and "DTEND" properties in
      "VAVAILABILITY" components and "AVAILABLE" sub-components MUST be
      "DATE-TIME" values specified as either date with UTC time or date
      with local time and a time zone reference.

      If any property with a "DATE-TIME" value is present in a
      "VAVAILABILITY" component or any of its "AVAILABLE" sub-
      components, and that property includes a "TZID" parameter, then
      the iCalendar object containing the "VAVAILABILITY" component MUST
      contain "VTIMEZONE" components corresponding to each unique "TZID"
      parameter value.

      When used to publish available time, the "ORGANIZER" property
      specifies the calendar user associated with the published
      available time.

   Example:  The following is an example of a "VAVAILABILITY" calendar
      component used to represent the availability of a user always
      available Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM in the
      America/Montreal time zone:

        BEGIN:VAVAILABILITY

      The following is an example of three "VAVAILABILITY" calendar
      components used to represent the availability of a traveling
      worker: Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM each day.
      However, for three weeks the calendar user is working in Montreal,
      then one week in Los Angeles, then back to Montreal.  Note that
      each overall period is covered by separate "VAVAILABILITY"
      components.  The last of these has no DTEND so continues on "for
      ever".  This example shows how "blocks" of available time can be
      represented.

        busytype      = "BUSYTYPE" busytypeparam ":" busytypevalue CRLF

        busytypeparam = *(";" other-param)

        busytypevalue = "BUSY" / "BUSY-UNAVAILABLE" /
                        "BUSY-TENTATIVE" / iana-token / x-name
                        ; Default is "BUSY-UNAVAILABLE".

   Description:  This property is used to specify the default busy time
      type.  The values correspond to those used by the "FBTYPE"
      parameter used on a "FREEBUSY" property, with the exception that
      the "FREE" value is not used in this property.  If not specified
      on a component that allows this property, the default is "BUSY-
      UNAVAILABLE".

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

        BUSYTYPE:BUSY


4.  Calculating Free-Busy Time

   This section describes how free-busy time information for a calendar
   user is calculated in the presence of "VAVAILABILITY" calendar
   components.

   An iCalendar "VFREEBUSY" component is used to convey "rolled-up"
   free-busy time information for a calendar user.  This can be
   generated as the result of an iTIP free-busy [RFC5546] request or
   through some other mechanism (e.g., a CalDAV calendar-access CALDAV:
   free-busy-query REPORT).

   When a "VAVAILABILITY" component is present and intersects the time-

Internet-Draft            Calendar Availability               April 2011


   range for the free-busy request, the time covered by the
   "VAVAILABILITY" component is set to busy and then portions of it
   "carved out" to be free based on the "AVAILABLE" components in the
   "VAVAILABILITY" component.  Once that is done, regular "VEVENT" and
   "VFREEBUSY" components can be "overlaid" in the usual way to block
   out additional time.

   An example procedure for this is as follows:

   1.  Initially mark the entire period of the free-busy request as
       free.

   2.  For each "VAVAILABILITY" component:

       1.  Determine if the "VAVAILABILITY" intersects the time-range of
           the free-busy request.  If not ignore it.

       2.  For the time period covered by the "VAVAILABILITY" component,
           mark time in the free-busy request result set as busy, using
           the busy time type derived from the "BUSYTYPE" property in
           the "VAVAILABILITY" component.

   3.  For each intersecting "VAVAILABILITY" component:

       1.  For each "AVAILABLE" component in the "VAVAILABILITY"
           component:

           1.  Expand all recurring instances, taking into account
               overridden instances, ignoring those not within the free-
               busy request time-range.

           2.  For each instance, mark the corresponding time in the
               free-busy request result set as free.

   4.  For each "VEVENT" or "VFREEBUSY" component apply normal free-busy
       processing within the free-busy request time-range.

4.1.  Examples

   In the examples below a table is used to represent time slots for the
   period of a free-busy request.  Each time slot is two hours long.
   The column header represents the hours from midnight local time.
   Each row below the column headers represents a step in the free-busy
   result set determination, following the procedure outlined above.

   Each cell in the rows below the column header contains a single
   character that represents the free-busy type for the corresponding
   time period at the end of the process step represented by the row.

   The characters in the row are:

     +-----------+--------------------------------------------------+
     | Character | Meaning                                          |
     +-----------+--------------------------------------------------+
     | F         | Represents "FREE" time in that slot.             |
     | B         | Represents "BUSY" time in that slot.             |
     | U         | Represents "BUSY-UNAVAILABLE" time in that slot. |
     | T         | Represents "BUSY-TENTATIVE" time in that slot.   |
     +-----------+--------------------------------------------------+

4.1.1.  Simple Example

   A free-busy request for Monday, 6th November 2011, midnight to
   midnight in the America/Montreal timezone.

   The user's calendar is as shown in Appendix A.  This includes one
   "VAVAILABILITY" component giving available time within the requested
   time-range of 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, together with one "VEVENT"
   component representing a two hour meeting starting at 12:00 PM.

5.  CalDAV Extensions

5.1.  CalDAV Requirements Overview

   This section lists what functionality is required of a CalDAV server
   which supports this extension.  A server:

   o  MUST support "VAVAILABILITY" components in a calendar collection
      resource if the CALDAV calendar-access feature is supported, which
      includes advertising it in CALDAV;supported-calendar-component-set
      properties on calendars;





Daboo & Desruisseaux    Expires October 16, 2011               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft            Calendar Availability               April 2011


   o  MUST support CALDAV:free-busy-query REPORTs that aggregate the
      information in any "VAVAILABILITY" components in the calendar
      collections targeted by the request;

   o  MUST support "VAVAILABILITY" components stored in a CALDAV:
      calendar-availability WebDAV property on a CALDAV scheduling inbox
      collection if the CALDAV calendar-auto-schedule feature is
      supported;

   o  MUST support iTIP [RFC5546] free-busy requests that aggregate the
      information in any "VAVAILABILITY" components in calendar
      collections that contribute to free-busy, or in any
      "VAVAILABILITY" components stored in the CALDAV:calendar-
      availability in the CALDAV scheduling inbox collection of the
      calendar user targeted by the iTIP free-busy request, if the
      CalDAV calendar-auto-schedule feature is available.

5.2.  New features in CalDAV

5.2.1.  Calendar Availability Support

   A server supporting the features described in this document MUST
   include "calendar-availability" as a field in the DAV response header
   from an OPTIONS request on any resource that supports any calendar
   properties, reports, method, or privilege.  A value of "calendar-
   availability" in the DAV response header MUST indicate that the
   server supports all MUST level requirements specified in this
   document.

5.2.1.1.  Example: Using OPTIONS for the Discovery of Calendar
          Availability Support

   >> Request <<

      OPTIONS /home/bernard/calendars/ HTTP/1.1
      Host: cal.example.com

   >> Response <<

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Allow: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, COPY, MOVE
      Allow: PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, LOCK, UNLOCK, REPORT, ACL
      DAV: 1, 2, 3, access-control, calendar-access,
       calendar-availability
      Date: Fri, 11 Nov 2005 09:32:12 GMT
      Content-Length: 0

   In this example, the OPTIONS method returns the value "calendar-

   availability" in the DAV response header to indicate that the
   collection "/home/bernard/calendars/" supports the new features
   defined in this specification.

5.2.2.  CALDAV:free-busy-query REPORT

   A CALDAV:free-busy-query REPORT can be executed on a calendar
   collection that contains iCalendar "VAVAILABILITY" components.  When
   that is done, the server MUST aggregate the information in any
   "VAVAILABILITY" components when generating the free-busy response, as
   described in Section 4.

5.2.3.  CALDAV:calendar-availability Property

   Name:  calendar-availability

   Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav

   Purpose:  Defines a "VAVAILABILITY" component that will be used in
      calculating free-busy time when an iTIP free-busy request is
      targeted at the calendar user who owns the Inbox.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be protected and SHOULD NOT be
      returned by a PROPFIND DAV:allprop request.  Support for this
      property is REQUIRED.  The value of this property MUST be a valid
      iCalendar object containing "VAVAILABILITY" components and
      "VTIMEZONE" components (if required) only.

   Description:  This property allows a user to specify their
      availability by including "VAVAILABILITY" components in the value
      of this property.  If present, the server MUST use these
      "VAVAILABILITY" components when determining free-busy information
      as part of an iTIP free-busy request being handled by the server.

   Definition:

      <!ELEMENT calendar-availability (#PCDATA) >
      ; Data value MUST be iCalendar object containing
      ; "VAVAILABILITY" or "VTIMEZONE" components.

5.2.4.  iTIP free-busy requests

   The [I-D.desruisseaux-caldav-sched] processing of an iTIP free-busy
   request targeted at the owner of the CALDAV:schedule-inbox will
   include free-busy information derived from "VAVAILABILITY" components
   in any calendar collection targeted during the request, as described
   in Section 4.  In addition, any "VAVAILABILITY" components specified
   in the CALDAV:calendar-availability property on the owner's Inbox,
   MUST be included in the free-busy calculation.

Internet-Draft            Calendar Availability               April 2011


6.  Security Considerations

   Free-busy information generated from "VAVAILABILITY" components MUST
   NOT include information other than busy or free time periods.  In
   particular, user specified property values such as "SUMMARY" and
   "DESCRIPTION" MUST NOT be copied into the free-busy result data.

   Beyond this, this specification does not add any additional security
   issues that are not already present in [RFC5545] and [RFC5546].


7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Component Registrations

   This documents defines the following new iCalendar components to be
   added to the registry defined in Section 8.2.2 of [RFC5545]:

            | Component     | Status  | Reference            |
            +---------------+---------+----------------------+
            | VAVAILABILITY | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 3.1 |
            | AVAILABLE     | Current | RFCXXXX, Section 3.1 |
            +---------------+---------+----------------------+

7.2.  Property Registrations
