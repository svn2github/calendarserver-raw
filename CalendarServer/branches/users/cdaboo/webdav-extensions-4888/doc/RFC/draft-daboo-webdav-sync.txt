Internet-Draft                 WebDAV Sync                 November 2009


1.  Introduction

   WebDAV [RFC4918] defines the concept of 'collections' which are
   hierarchical groupings of WebDAV resources on an HTTP [RFC2616]
   server.  Collections can be of arbitrary size and depth (i.e.,
   collections within collections).  WebDAV clients that cache resource
   content need a way to synchronize that data with the server (i.e.,
   detect what has changed and update their cache).  This can currently
   be done using a WebDAV PROPFIND request on a collection to list all
   members of a collection along with their DAV:getetag property values,
   which allows the client to determine which resources were changed,
   added or deleted.  However, this does not scale well to large
   collections as the XML response to the PROPFIND request will grow
   with the collection size.

   This specification defines a new WebDAV report that results in the
   server returning to the client only information about those resources
   which have changed, are new or were deleted since a previous
   execution of the report on the collection.

   Additionally, a new property is added to collection resources that is
   used to convey a "synchronization token" that is guaranteed to change
   when resources within the collection have changed.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses XML DTD fragments ([W3C.REC-xml-20081126], Section
   3.2) as a purely notational convention.  WebDAV request and response
   bodies cannot be validated by a DTD due to the specific extensibility
   rules defined in Section 17 of [RFC4918] and due to the fact that all
   XML elements defined by this specification use the XML namespace name
   "DAV:".  In particular:

   1.  element names use the "DAV:" namespace,

   2.  element ordering is irrelevant unless explicitly stated,

   3.  extension elements (elements not already defined as valid child
       elements) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly stated
       otherwise,

   4.  extension attributes (attributes not already defined as valid for
       this element) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly
       stated otherwise.

   When an XML element type in the "DAV:" namespace is referenced in
   this document outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string
   "DAV:" will be prefixed to the element type.

   This document inherits, and sometimes extends, DTD productions from
   Section 14 of [RFC4918].

3.  Open Issues

   1.  We are extending the multistatus response element in a
       significant way.  The DAV:sync-response differs from a regular
       DAV:response because, in the case of a created or modified
       resource, it contains both a DAV:status (201 for created, 200 for
       modified) and a DAV:propstat.  The DAV:response on the other hand
       contains either a DAV:status or a DAV:propstat but not both.
       Shall we define a DAV:multisyncstatus response element instead of
       overloading DAV:multistatus ?

   2.  Do clients really need to be notified that a resource was created
       versus modified ?  They should be able to figure that out by
       looking at the state of their current cache.  If this information
       is not necessary, the response would not need to contain a DAV:
       status along with the DAV:propstat.  This would allow the use of
       a regular multistatus (simply extended with a sync-token
       element).

4.  WebDAV Synchronization

4.1.  Overview

   One way to synchronize data between two entities is to use some form
   of synchronization token.  The token defines the state of the data
   being synchronized at a particular point in time.  It can then be
   used to determine what has changed since one point in time and
   another.

   This specification defines a new WebDAV report that is used to enable
   client-server collection synchronization based on such a token.

   In order to synchronize the contents of a collection between a server
   and client, the server provides the client with a synchronization
   token each time the synchronization report is executed.  That token
   represents the state of the data being synchronized at that point in
   time.  The client can then present that same token back to the server
   at some later time and the server will return only those items that
   are new, have changed or were deleted since that token was generated.
   The server also returns a new token representing the new state at the
   time the report was run.

Internet-Draft                 WebDAV Sync                 November 2009


   Typically the first time a client connects to the server it will need
   to be informed of the entire state of the collection (i.e., a full
   list of all resources that are currently contained in the
   collection).  That is done by the client sending an empty token value
   to the server.  This indicates to the server that a full listing is
   required.  As an alternative, the client may choose to do its first
   synchronization using some other mechanism on the collection (e.g.
   some other form of batch resource information retrieval such as
   PROPFIND, SEARCH [RFC5323], or specialized REPORTs such as those
   defined in CalDAV [RFC4791] and CardDAV [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-carddav])
   and ask for the DAV:sync-token property to be returned.  This
   property (defined in Section 5) contains the same token that can be
   used later on to issue a DAV:sync-collection report.

   In some cases a server may only wish to maintain a limited amount of
   history about changes to a collection.  In that situation it will
   return an error to the client when the client presents a token that
   is "out of date".  At that point the client has to fall back to
   synchronizing the entire collection by re-running the report request
   using an empty token value.  ACL changes may also cause a token to
   become invalid.

4.2.  DAV:sync-collection report

   This specification defines the DAV:sync-collection report.

   If this report is implemented by a WebDAV server, then the server
   MUST list the report in the "DAV:supported-report-set" property on
   any collection supporting synchronization.

   To implement the behavior for this report a server needs to keep
   track of changes to any resources in a collection.  This includes
   noting the addition of new resources, changes to existing resources
   and removal of resources (where "removal" could be the result of a
   DELETE or MOVE WebDAV request).  Only internal members of the
   collection (as defined in [RFC4918]) are to be considered.  The
   server will track each change and provide a synchronization "token"
   to the client that describes the state of the server at a specific
   point in time.  This "token" is returned as part of the response to
   the "sync-collection" report.  Clients include the last token they
   got from the server in the next "sync-collection" report that they
   execute and the server provides the changes from the previous state,
   represented by the token, to the current state, represented by the
   new token returned.

   The synchronization token itself is an "opaque" string - i.e., the
   actual string data has no specific meaning or syntax.  A simple
   implementation of such a token would be a numeric counter that counts

   each change as it occurs and relates that change to the specific
   object that changed.

   Marshalling:

      The request URI MUST be a collection.  The request body MUST be a
      DAV:sync-collection XML element (see Section 6.1), which MUST
      contain one DAV:sync-token XML element, and optionally a DAV:
      propstat XML element.

      The request MUST include a Depth header with a value of "1".

      The response body for a successful request MUST be a DAV:
      multistatus XML element, which MUST contain one DAV:sync-token
      element in addition to any DAV:sync-response elements.

      The response body for a successful DAV:sync-collection report
      request MUST contain a DAV:sync-response element for each resource
      that was created, has changed or been deleted since the last
      synchronization operation as specified by the DAV:sync-token
      provided in the request.  A given resource MUST appear only once
      in the response.

      The DAV:status element in each DAV:sync-response element is used
      to indicate how the resource may have changed:

         A status code of '201 Created' is used to indicate resources
         that are new.

         A status code of '200 OK' is used to indicate resources that
         have changed.

         A status code of '404 Not Found' is used to indicate resources
         that have been removed.

      The conditions under which each type of change may occur is
      further described in Section 4.3.

   Preconditions:

      (DAV:valid-sync-token): The DAV:sync-token element value MUST map
      to a valid token previously returned by the server.  A token may
      become invalid as the result of being "out of date" (out of the
      range of change history maintained by the server), or for other
      reasons (e.g. collection deleted, then recreated, ACL changes,
      etc...).

   Postconditions:

      None.

4.3.  Types of changes reported

   Three types of resource state changes can be returned by the DAV:
   sync-collection report (new, modified, removed).  This section
   further defines under which condition each of them shall be used.  It
   also clarifies the case where a resource may have undergone multiple
   changes in between two synchronizations.

4.3.1.  New resource

   A resource MUST be reported as new if it has been mapped directly
   under the target collection since the request sync token was
   generated.  This includes resources that have been mapped as the
   result of a COPY, MOVE or BIND ([I-D.ietf-webdav-bind]) operation.
   This also includes collection resources that have been created.

   In the case where a mapping between a resource and the target
   collection was removed, then a new mapping with the same URI created,
   the new resource MUST be reported as new, while the old resource MUST
   NOT be reported as removed.  For example, if a resource was deleted,
   then recreated using the same URI, it should be reported as a new
   resource only.

   A resource MAY be reported as new if the user issuing the request was
   granted access to this resource, due to access control changes.

4.3.2.  Modified resource

   A resource MUST be reported as modified if it is not reported as new
   and if its entity tag value (defined in [RFC2616]) has changed since
   the request sync token was generated.  In other words, the new
   resource change indicator takes precedence over the modified resource
   change indicator.

   Collection resources MUST NOT be returned as modified.  Instead
   clients are expected to synchronize changes in child collection
   resources on an individual basis.

4.3.3.  Removed resource

   A resource MUST be reported as removed if its mapping under the
   target collection has been removed since the request sync token was
   generated, and it has not been re-mapped since it was removed.  This
   includes resources that have been unmapped as the result of a MOVE or
   UNBIND ([I-D.ietf-webdav-bind]) operation.  This also includes
   collection resources that have been removed.

   If a resource was created (and possibly modified), then removed in
   between two synchronizations, it MUST NOT be reported as new,
   modified or removed.

   A resource MAY be reported as removed if the user issuing the request
   has no longer access to this resource, due to access control changes.

4.4.  Example: Initial DAV:sync-collection REPORT

   In this example, the client is making its first synchronization
   request to the server, so the DAV:sync-token element in the request
   is empty.  It also asks for the DAV:getetag property.  The server
   responds with the items currently in the targeted collection
   (indicating that they are 'new' via the '201 Created' status code).
   The current synchronization token is also returned.

4.5.  Example: DAV:sync-collection Report with token

   In this example, the client is making a synchronization request to
   the server and is using the DAV:sync-token element returned from the
   last report it ran on this collection.  The server responds listing
   the items that have been added, changed or removed.  The (new)
   current synchronization token is also returned.

   Name:  sync-token

   Namespace:  DAV:

Internet-Draft                 WebDAV Sync                 November 2009


   Purpose:  Contains the value of the synchronization token as it would
      be returned by a DAV:sync-collection report.

   Value:  Any text.

   Protected:  MUST be protected because this value is created and
      controlled by the server.

   COPY/MOVE behavior:  This property value is dependent on the final
      state of the destination resource, not the value of the property
      on the source resource.

   Description:  The DAV:sync-token property MUST be defined on all
      resources that support the DAV:sync-collection report.  It
      contains the value of the synchronization token as it would be
      returned by a DAV:sync-collection report on that resource at the
      same point in time.  It SHOULD NOT be returned by a PROPFIND DAV:
      allprop request (as defined in [RFC4918]).

   Definition:


   <!ELEMENT sync-token #PCDATA>


6.  XML Element Definitions
