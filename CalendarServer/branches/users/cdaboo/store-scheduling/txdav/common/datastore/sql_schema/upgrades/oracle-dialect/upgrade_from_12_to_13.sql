-- Attachment related updates

-- not needed; DROPBOX_ID becomes nullable after dropping primary key above
-- alter table ATTACHMENT
--  modify (DROPBOX_ID null);

-- We want ATTACHMENT_ID as a pkey, but can't yet since it needs unique values,
-- and oracle can't set a default column value from a sequence
alter table ATTACHMENT

-- fill in ATTACHMENT_ID with unique values from the sequence
update ATTACHMENT set ATTACHMENT_ID = ATTACHMENT_ID_SEQ.nextval;

-- now set ATTACHMENT_ID as primary key, which implies unique and not null
