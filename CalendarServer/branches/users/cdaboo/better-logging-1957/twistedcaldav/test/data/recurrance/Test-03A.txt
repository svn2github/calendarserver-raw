This is a more complicated example.Chair sends recurring meeting to invitee that starts Monday April 25, 2005 and repeats everyday for 5 days from 0900-1000.  This should yield a recurring meeting with following date/times:    04/25/05    0900-1000    04/26/05    0900-1000    04/27/05    0900-1000    04/28/05    0900-1000    04/29/05    0900-1000
