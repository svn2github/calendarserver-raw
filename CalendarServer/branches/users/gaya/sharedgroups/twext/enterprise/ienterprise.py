    def commandBlock():
        """
        Create an object which will cause the commands executed on it to be
        grouped together.

        This is useful when using database-specific features such as
        sub-transactions where order of execution is importnat, but where
        application code may need to perform I/O to determine what SQL, exactly,
        it wants to execute.  Consider this fairly contrived example for an
        imaginary database::

            def storeWebPage(url, block):
                block.execSQL("BEGIN SUB TRANSACTION")
                got = getPage(url)
                def gotPage(data):
                    block.execSQL("INSERT INTO PAGES (TEXT) VALUES (?)", [data])
                    block.execSQL("INSERT INTO INDEX (TOKENS) VALUES (?)",
                                 [tokenize(data)])
                    lastStmt = block.execSQL("END SUB TRANSACTION")
                    block.end()
                    return lastStmt
                return got.addCallback(gotPage)
            gatherResults([storeWebPage(url, txn.commandBlock())
                          for url in urls]).addCallbacks(
                            lambda x: txn.commit(), lambda f: txn.abort()
                          )

        This fires off all the C{getPage} requests in parallel, and prepares all
        the necessary SQL immediately as the results arrive, but executes those
        statements in order.  In the above example, this makes sure to store the
        page and its tokens together, another use for this might be to store a
        computed aggregate (such as a sum) at a particular point in a
        transaction, without sacrificing parallelism.

        @rtype: L{ICommandBlock}
        """



class ICommandBlock(ISQLExecutor):
    """
    This is a block of SQL commands that are grouped together.

    @see: L{IAsyncTransaction.commandBlock}
    """

    def end():
        """
        End this command block, allowing other commands queued on the underlying
        transaction to end.

        @note: This is I{not} the same as either L{IAsyncTransaction.commit} or
            L{IAsyncTransaction.abort}, since it does not denote success or
            failure; merely that the command block has completed and other
            statements may now be executed.  Since sub-transactions are a
            database-specific feature, they must be implemented at a
            higher-level than this facility provides (although this facility may
            be useful in their implementation).  Also note that, unlike either
            of those methods, this does I{not} return a Deferred: if you want to
            know when the block has completed, simply add a callback to the last
            L{ICommandBlock.execSQL} call executed on this L{ICommandBlock}.
            (This may be changed in a future version for the sake of
            convenience, however.)

class IDerivedParameter(Interface):

    C{prequery} and C{postquery} methods invoked on it before and after
    executing the SQL query in question, respectively.

    @note: L{IDerivedParameter} providers must also always be I{pickleable},
        because in some cases the actual database cursor objects will be on the
        other end of a network connection.  For an explanation of why this
