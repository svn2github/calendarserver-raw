Internet-Draft                 WebDAV Sync                     July 2011


1.  Introduction

   WebDAV [RFC4918] defines the concept of 'collections' which are
   hierarchical groupings of WebDAV resources on an HTTP [RFC2616]
   server.  Collections can be of arbitrary size and depth (i.e.,
   collections within collections).  WebDAV clients that cache resource
   content need a way to synchronize that data with the server (i.e.,
   detect what has changed and update their cache).  This can currently
   be done using a WebDAV PROPFIND request on a collection to list all
   members of a collection along with their DAV:getetag property values,
   which allows the client to determine which were changed, added or
   deleted.  However, this does not scale well to large collections as
   the XML response to the PROPFIND request will grow with the
   collection size.

   This specification defines a new WebDAV report that results in the
   server returning to the client only information about those member
   URIs that were added or deleted, or whose mapped resources were
   changed, since a previous execution of the report on the collection.

   Additionally, a new property is added to collection resources that is
   used to convey a "synchronization token" that is guaranteed to change
   when the collection's member URIs or their mapped resources have
   changed.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses XML DTD fragments ([W3C.REC-xml-20081126], Section
   3.2) as a purely notational convention.  WebDAV request and response
   bodies cannot be validated by a DTD due to the specific extensibility
   rules defined in Section 17 of [RFC4918] and due to the fact that all
   XML elements defined by this specification use the XML namespace name
   "DAV:".  In particular:

   1.  element names use the "DAV:" namespace,

   2.  element ordering is irrelevant unless explicitly stated,

   3.  extension elements (elements not already defined as valid child
       elements) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly stated
       otherwise,

   4.  extension attributes (attributes not already defined as valid for
       this element) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly

       stated otherwise.

   When an XML element type in the "DAV:" namespace is referenced in
   this document outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string
   "DAV:" will be prefixed to the element type.

   This document inherits, and sometimes extends, DTD productions from
   Section 14 of [RFC4918].

3.  WebDAV Synchronization

3.1.  Overview

   One way to synchronize data between two entities is to use some form
   of synchronization token.  The token defines the state of the data
   being synchronized at a particular point in time.  It can then be
   used to determine what has changed since one point in time and
   another.

   This specification defines a new WebDAV report that is used to enable
   client-server collection synchronization based on such a token.

   In order to synchronize the contents of a collection between a server
   and client, the server provides the client with a synchronization
   token each time the synchronization report is executed.  That token
   represents the state of the data being synchronized at that point in
   time.  The client can then present that same token back to the server
   at some later time and the server will return only those items that
   are new, have changed or were deleted since that token was generated.
   The server also returns a new token representing the new state at the
   time the report was run.

   Typically, the first time a client connects to the server it will
   need to be informed of the entire state of the collection (i.e., a
   full list of all member URIs that are currently in the collection).
   That is done by the client sending an empty token value to the
   server.  This indicates to the server that a full listing is
   required.

   As an alternative, the client might choose to do its first
   synchronization using some other mechanism on the collection (e.g.
   some other form of batch resource information retrieval such as
   PROPFIND, SEARCH [RFC5323] , or specialized REPORTs such as those
   defined in CalDAV [RFC4791] and CardDAV [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-carddav])
   and ask for the DAV:sync-token property to be returned.  This
   property (defined in Section 4) contains the same token that can be
   used later on to issue a DAV:sync-collection report.

   In some cases a server might only wish to maintain a limited amount
   of history about changes to a collection.  In that situation it will
   return an error to the client when the client presents a token that
   is "out of date".  At that point the client has to fall back to
   synchronizing the entire collection by re-running the report request
   using an empty token value.

3.2.  DAV:sync-collection Report

   If the DAV:sync-collection report is implemented by a WebDAV server,
   then the server MUST list the report in the "DAV:supported-report-
   set" property on any collection supporting synchronization.

   To implement the behavior for this report a server needs to keep
   track of changes to any member URIs and their mapped resources in a
   collection (as defined in Section 3 of [RFC4918]).  This includes
   noting the addition of new member URIs, changes to the mapped
   resources of existing member URIs, and removal of member URIs.  The
   server will track each change and provide a synchronization "token"
   to the client that describes the state of the server at a specific
   point in time.  This "token" is returned as part of the response to
   the "sync-collection" report.  Clients include the last token they
   got from the server in the next "sync-collection" report that they
   execute and the server provides the changes from the previous state,
   represented by the token, to the current state, represented by the
   new token returned.

   The synchronization token itself is an "opaque" string - i.e., the
   actual string data has no specific meaning or syntax.  However, the
   token MUST be a valid URI to allow its use in an If pre-condition
   request header (see Section 5).  For example, a simple implementation
   of such a token could be a numeric counter that counts each change as
   it occurs and relates that change to the specific object that
   changed.  The numeric value could be appended to a "base" URI to form
   the valid sync-token.

   Marshalling:

      The request URI MUST identify a collection.  The request body MUST
      be a DAV:sync-collection XML element (see Section 6.1), which MUST
      contain one DAV:sync-token XML element, and one DAV:prop XML
      element, and MAY contain a DAV:limit XML element.

      The request MUST include a Depth header with a value of "1" or
      "infinity".

      The response body for a successful request MUST be a DAV:
      multistatus XML element, which MUST contain one DAV:sync-token

      element in addition to one DAV:response element for each member
      URI that was added, has had its mapped resource changed, or was
      deleted since the last synchronization operation as specified by
      the DAV:sync-token provided in the request.  A given member URI
      MUST appear only once in the response.  In the case where multiple
      member URIs of the request-URI are mapped to the same resource, if
      the resource is changed, each member URI MUST be returned in the
      response.

      The content of each DAV:response element differs depending on how
      the member was altered:

         For members that have changed (i.e., are new or have had their
         mapped resource modified) the DAV:response MUST contain at
         least one DAV:propstat element and MUST NOT contain any DAV:
         status element.

         For members that have been removed, the DAV:response MUST
         contain one DAV:status with a value set to '404 Not Found' and
         MUST NOT contain any DAV:propstat element.

         For members that are collections and are unable to support the
         DAV:sync-collection report, the DAV:response MUST contain one
         DAV:status with a value set to '403 Forbidden', a DAV:error
         containing DAV:supported-report or DAV:sync-traversal-supported
         (see Section 3.3 for which is appropriate), and MUST NOT
         contain any DAV:propstat element.

      The conditions under which each type of change can occur is
      further described in Section 3.5.

   Preconditions:

      (DAV:valid-sync-token): The DAV:sync-token element value MUST be a
      valid token previously returned by the server.  A token can become
      invalid as the result of being "out of date" (out of the range of
      change history maintained by the server), or for other reasons
      (e.g. collection deleted, then recreated, access control changes,
      etc...).

   Postconditions:

      (DAV:number-of-matches-within-limits): The number of changes
      reported in the response must fall within the client specified
      limit.  This condition might be triggered if a client requests a
      limit on the number of responses (as per Section 3.7) but the
      server is unable to truncate the result set at or below that
      limit.

3.3.  Depth behavior

   Servers MUST support both Depth:1 and Depth:infinity behavior with
   the DAV:sync-collection report.  Clients MUST include either a
   Depth:1 or Depth:infinity request header with the DAV:sync-collection
   report.

   o  When the client specifies a Depth:1 request header, only
      appropriate internal member URIs (immediate children) of the
      collection specified as the request URI are reported.

   o  When the client specifies a Depth:infinity request header, all
      appropriate member URIs of the collection specified as the request
      URI are reported, provided child collections themselves also
      support the DAV:sync-collection report.

   o  DAV:sync-token values returned by the server are not specific to
      the value of the Depth header used in the request.  As such
      clients MAY use a DAV:sync-token value from a request with one
      Depth value for a similar request with a different Depth value,
      however the utility of this is limited.

   Note that when a server supports Depth:infinity reports, it might not
   be possible to synchronize some child collections within the
   collection targeted by the report.  When this occurs, the server MUST
   include a DAV:response element for the child collection with status
   '403 Forbidden'.  The 403 response MUST be sent once, when the
   collection is first reported to the client.  In addition, the server
   MUST include a DAV:error element in the DAV:response element,
   indicating one of two possible causes for this:

      The DAV:sync-collection report is not supported at all on the
      child collection.  The DAV:error element MUST contain the DAV:
      supported-report element.

      The server is unwilling to report results for the child collection
      when a Depth:infinity DAV:sync-collection report is executed on a
      parent resource.  This might happen when, for example, the
      synchronization state of the collection resource is controlled by
      another sub-system.  In such cases clients can perform the DAV:
      sync-collection report directly on the child collection instead.
      The DAV:error element MUST contain the DAV:sync-traversal-
      supported element.

3.4.  Types of Changes Reported on Initial Synchronization

   When the DAV:sync-collection request contains an empty DAV:sync-token
   element, the server MUST return all member URIs of the collection
   (taking account of Depth header requirements as per Section 3.3, and
   optional truncation of results set as per Section 3.6) and it MUST
   NOT return any removed member URIs.  All types of member (collection
   or non-collection) MUST be reported.

3.5.  Types of Changes Reported on Subsequent Synchronizations

   When the DAV:sync-collection request contains a valid value for the
   DAV:sync-token element, two types of member URI state changes can be
   returned (changed or removed).  This section defines what triggers
   each of these to be returned.  It also clarifies the case where a
   member URI might have undergone multiple changes between two
   synchronization report requests.  In all cases, the Depth header
   requirements as per Section 3.3, and optional truncation of results
   set as per Section 3.6, are taken into account by the server.

3.5.1.  Changed Member

   A member URI MUST be reported as changed if it has been mapped as a
   member of the target collection since the request sync-token was
   generated.  This includes member URIs that have been mapped as the
   result of a COPY, MOVE, BIND [RFC5842], or REBIND [RFC5842] request.
   All types of member URI (collection or non-collection) MUST be
   reported.

   In the case where a mapping between a member URI and the target
   collection was removed, then a new mapping with the same URI created,
   the member URI MUST be reported as changed and MUST NOT be reported
   as removed.

   A member URI MUST be reported as changed if its mapped resource's
   entity tag value (defined in Section 3.11 of [RFC2616]) has changed
   since the request sync-token was generated.

   A member URI MAY be reported as changed if the user issuing the
   request was granted access to this member URI, due to access control
   changes.

   Collection member URIs MUST be returned as changed if they are mapped
   to an underlying resource (i.e., entity body) and if the entity tag
   associated with that resource changes.  There is no guarantee that
   changes to members of a collection will result in a change in any
   entity tag of that collection, so clients cannot rely on a series of
   Depth:1 reports at multiple levels to track all changes within a

Internet-Draft                 WebDAV Sync                     July 2011


   collection.  Instead Depth:infinity has to be used.

3.5.2.  Removed Member

   A member MUST be reported as removed if its mapping under the target
   collection has been removed since the request sync-token was
   generated, and it has not been re-mapped since it was removed.  This
   includes members that have been unmapped as the result of a MOVE,
   UNBIND [RFC5842], or REBIND [RFC5842] operation.  This also includes
   collection members that have been removed, including ones that
   themselves do not support the DAV:sync-collection report.

   If a member was added (and its mapped resource possibly modified),
   then removed between two synchronization report requests, it MUST be
   reported as removed.  This ensures that a client that adds a member
   is informed of the removal of the member, if the removal occurs
   before the client has had a chance to execute a synchronization
   report.

   A member MAY be reported as removed if the user issuing the request
   no longer has access to this member, due to access control changes.

   For a Depth:infinity report where a collection is removed, the server
   MUST NOT report the removal of any members of the removed collection.
   Clients MUST assume that if a collection is reported as being
   removed, then all members of that collection have also been removed.

3.6.  Truncation of Results

   A server MAY limit the number of member URIs in a response, for
   example, to limit the amount of work expended in processing a
   request, or as the result of an explicit limit set by the client.  If
   the result set is truncated, the response MUST use status code 207,
   return a DAV:multistatus response body, and indicate a status of 507
   (Insufficient Storage) for the request URI.  That DAV:response
   element SHOULD include a DAV:error element with the DAV:number-of-
   matches-within-limits precondition, as defined in [RFC3744] (Section
   9.2).  DAV:response elements for all the changes being reported are
   also included.

   When truncation occurs, the DAV:sync-token value returned in the
   response MUST represent the correct state for the partial set of
   changes returned.  That allows the client to use the returned DAV:
   sync-token to fetch the next set of changes.  In this way the client
   can effectively "page" through the entire set of changes in a
   consistent manner.

   Clients MUST handle the 507 status on the request-URI in the response

   to the report.

   For example, consider a server that records changes using a
   monotonically increasing integer to represent a "revision number" and
   uses that quantity as the DAV:sync-token value (appropriately encoded
   as a URI).  Assume the last DAV:sync-token used by the client was
   "http://example.com/sync/10", and since then 15 additional changes
   have occurred.  If the client executes a DAV:sync-collection request
   with a DAV:sync-token of "http://example.com/sync/10", without a
   limit the server would return 15 DAV:response elements and a DAV:
   sync-token with value "http://example.com/sync/25".  But if the
   server choose to limit responses to at most 10 changes, then it would
   return only 10 DAV:response elements and a DAV:sync-token with value
   "http://example.com/sync/20", together with an additional DAV:
   response element for the request-URI with a status code of 507.
   Subsequently, the client can re-issue the request with the DAV:sync-
   token value returned from the server and fetch the remaining 5
   changes.

3.7.  Limiting Results

   A client can limit the number of results returned by the server
   through use of the DAV:limit element ([RFC5323], Section 5.17) in the
   request body.  This is useful when clients have limited space or
   bandwidth for the results.  If a server is unable to truncate the
   result at or below the requested number, then it MUST fail the
   request with a DAV:number-of-matches-within-limits post-condition
   error.  When the results can be correctly limited by the server, the
   server MUST follow the rules above for indicating a result set
   truncation to the client.

3.8.  Example: Initial DAV:sync-collection Report

   In this example, the client is making its first synchronization
   request to the server, so the DAV:sync-token element in the request
   is empty.  It also asks for the DAV:getetag property and for a
   proprietary property.  The server responds with the items currently
   in the targeted collection.  The current synchronization token is
   also returned.

4.  DAV:sync-token Property

   Name:  sync-token

   Namespace:  DAV:

   Purpose:  Contains the value of the synchronization token as it would
      be returned by a DAV:sync-collection report.

   Value:  Any valid URI.

   Protected:  MUST be protected because this value is created and
      controlled by the server.

   COPY/MOVE behavior:  This property value is dependent on the final
      state of the destination resource, not the value of the property
      on the source resource.

   Description:  The DAV:sync-token property MUST be defined on all
      resources that support the DAV:sync-collection report.  It
      contains the value of the synchronization token as it would be
      returned by a DAV:sync-collection report on that resource at the
      same point in time.  It SHOULD NOT be returned by a PROPFIND DAV:

5.  DAV:sync-token Use with If Header

   WebDAV provides an If pre-condition header that allows for "state
   tokens" to be used as pre-conditions on HTTP requests (as defined in
   Section 10.4 of [RFC4918]).  This specification allows the DAV:sync-
   token value to be used as one such token in an If header.  By using
   this, clients can ensure requests only complete when there have been
   no changes to the content of a collection, by virtue of an un-changed

   DAV:sync-token value.  Servers MUST support use of DAV:sync-token
   values in If request headers.

5.1.  Example: If Pre-Condition with PUT

   In this example, the client has already used the DAV:sync-collection
   report to synchronize the collection /home/cyrusdaboo/collection/.
   Now it wants to add a new resource to the collection, but only if
   there have been no other changes since the last synchronization.
   Note, that because the DAV:sync-token is defined on the collection
   and not on the resource targeted by the request, the If header value
   needs to use the "Resource_Tag" construct for the header syntax to
   correctly identify that the supplied state token refers to the
   collection resource.

   >> Request <<


   PUT /home/cyrusdaboo/collection/newresource.txt HTTP/1.1
   Host: webdav.example.com
   If: </home/cyrusdaboo/collection/>
     (<http://example.com/ns/sync/12345>)
   Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
   Content-Length: xxxx

   Some content here...


   >> Response <<


   HTTP/1.1 201 Created


5.2.  Example: If Pre-Condition with MKCOL

   In this example, the client has already used the DAV:sync-collection
   report to synchronize the collection /home/cyrusdaboo/collection/.
   Now it wants to add a new collection to the collection, but only if
   there have been no other changes since the last synchronization.
   Note, that because the DAV:sync-token is defined on the collection
   and not on the resource targeted by the request, the If header value
   needs to use the "Resource_Tag" construct for the header syntax to
   correctly identify that the supplied state token refers to the
   collection resource.  In this case the request fails as another
   change has occurred to the collection corresponding to the supplied
   DAV:sync-token.

   Name:  sync-token

   Namespace:  DAV:

   Purpose:  The synchronization token provided by the server and
      returned by the client.

   Namespace:  DAV:

   Purpose:  Extends the DAV:multistatus element to include
      synchronization details.

   Description:  See Section 3.



   <!ELEMENT multistatus (DAV:response*, DAV:responsedescription?,
                          sync-token?) >

   <!-- DAV:multistatus originally defined in RFC 4918, Section 14.16
        but overridden here to add the DAV:sync-token element -->
   <!-- DAV:response defined in RFC 4918, Section 14.24 -->
   <!-- DAV:responsedescription defined in RFC 4918, Section 14.25 -->


7.  Security Considerations

   Servers MUST take care to limit the scope of DAV:sync-collection
   requests so that clients cannot use excessive server resources by
   executing, for example, a Depth:infinity report on the root URI.  For
   example, CalDAV [RFC4791] servers might only support the DAV:sync-
   collection report on user calendar home collections, and prevent use
   of the report on the parent resource of all calendar homes (assuming
   there is one).  That way each individual user's request is scoped to
   changes only within their own calendar home and not across the entire
   set of calendar users.

   Beyond the above considerations, this extension does not introduce
   any new security concerns than those already described in HTTP and
   WebDAV.

Appendix A.  Change History (to be removed prior to publication as an
             RFC)

   Changes in -06:

   1.  Changed the 405 error into a 403 with a DAV:error element.

   2.  Stated more clearly that both depth:1 and depth:infinity must be
       supported.

   3.  Tied up sync-token as URI changes.

   4.  Made BIND a normative reference.

   5.  Take into account REBIND.

   6.  Reworked text to more accurately make the distinction between
       member URIs and resources, which should clarify the interaction
       with extensions like BIND.

   Changes in -05:

   1.  Added option to use DAV:sync-token as an If pre-condition state
       token.

   2.  DAV:sync-token value now required to be a URI so it can be used
       in the If header.

   Changes in -04:

   1.  Depth:infinity support added.

   2.  Collection resources are now reported as changed if they have a
       valid entity tag associated with them.

   Changes in -03:

   1.  Changed D:propstat to D:prop in marshalling.

   2.  Added request for dead property in examples.

   3.  Made D:prop mandatory in request so that D:response always
       contains at least one D:propstat as per WebDAV definition.

   4.  Removed DAV:status from response when resource is created/
       modified, thus allowing to get rid of DAV:sync-response in favor
       of a regular DAV:response.  As a consequence, there is no longer
       any difference in the report between created and modified
       resources.

   5.  Resource created, then removed between 2 sync MUST be returned as
       removed.

   6.  Added ability for server to truncate results and indicate such to
       the client.

   7.  Added ability for client to request the server to limit the
       result set.

   Changes in -02:

   1.  Added definition of sync-token WebDAV property.

   2.  Added references to SEARCH, CalDAV, CardDAV as alternative ways
       to first synchronize a collection.

   3.  Added section defining under which condition each state change
       (new, modified, removed) should be reported.  Added reference to
       BIND.

   4.  Incorporated feedback from Julian Reschke and Ciny Joy.

   5.  More details on the use of the DAV:valid-sync-token precondition.

   Changes in -01:

   1.  Updated to 4918 reference.
