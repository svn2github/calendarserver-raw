Internet-Draft          Defining Well-Known URIs           November 2009


1.  Introduction

   It is increasingly common for Web-based protocols to require the
   discovery of policy or metadata before making a request.  For
   example, the Robots Exclusion Protocol specifies a way for automated
   processes to obtain permission to access resources; likewise, the
   Platform for Privacy Preferences [W3C.REC-P3P-20020416] tells user-
   agents how to discover privacy policy beforehand.

   While there are several ways to access per-resource metadata (e.g.,
   HTTP headers, WebDAV's PROPFIND [RFC4918]), the perceived overhead
   associated with them often precludes their use in these scenarios.

   When this happens, it is common to designate a "well-known location"
   for such metadata, so that it can be easily located.  However, this
   approach has the drawback of risking collisions, both with other such
   designated "well-known locations" and with pre-existing resources.

   To address this, this memo defines a path prefix in HTTP(S) URIs for
   these "well-known locations", "/.well-known/".  Future specifications
   that need to define a resource for such site-wide metadata can
   register their use to avoid collisions and minimise impingement upon
   sites' URI space.

   [[ Please discuss this draft on the apps-discuss@ietf.org [1] mailing
   list. ]]


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Well-Known URIs

   A well-known URI is a URI [RFC3986] whose path component begins with
   the characters "/.well-known/", and whose scheme is "HTTP", "HTTPS",
   or another scheme which has explicitly been specified to use well-
   known URIs.

   Applications that wish to mint new well-known URIs MUST register
   them, following the procedures in Section 5.1.

   For example, if an application registers the value 'example', the
   corresponding well-known URI on 'http://www.example.com/' would be
   'http://www.example.com/.well-known/example'.

Internet-Draft          Defining Well-Known URIs           November 2009


   Note that this specification defines neither how to determine the
   authority to use for a particular context, nor the scope of the
   metadata discovered by dereferencing the well-known URI; both should
   be defined by the application itself.

   Typically, a registration will reference a specification that defines
   the format and associated media type to be obtained by dereferencing
   the well-known URI.

   It MAY also contain additional information, such as the syntax of
   additional path components, query strings and/or fragment identifiers
   to be appended to the well-known URI, or protocol-specific details
   (e.g., HTTP [RFC2616] method handling).

   Note that this specification also does not define a format or media-
   type for the resource at located at "/.well-known/" and clients
   should not expect a resource to exist at that location.


4.  Security Considerations

   This memo does not specify the scope of applicability of metadata or
   policy obtained from a well-known URI, and does not specify how to
   discover a well-known URI for a particular application.  Individual
   applications using this mechanism must define both aspects.

   An attacker with certain types of limited access to a server may be
   able to affect how well-known URIs are served; for example, they may
   be able to upload a file at that location, or they may be able to
   cause a server to redirect a well-known URI to a URI that they
   control.

   Because most URI schemes rely on DNS to resolve names, they are
   vulnerable to "DNS rebinding" attacks, whereby a request can be
   directed to a server under the control of an attacker.


5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  The Well-Known URI Registry

   This document establishes the well-known URI registry.

   Well-known URIs are registered on the advice of one or more
   Designated Experts (appointed by the IESG or their delegate), with a
   Specification Required (using terminology from [RFC5226]).

   Registration requests consist of the completed registration template

Internet-Draft          Defining Well-Known URIs           November 2009


   (see Section 5.1.1), typically published in an RFC or Open Standard
   (in the sense described by [RFC2026], section 7).  However, to allow
   for the allocation of values prior to publication, the Designated
   Expert(s) may approve registration once they are satisfied that an
   RFC (or other Open Standard) will be published.

   Registration requests should be sent to the [TBD]@ietf.org mailing
   list for review and comment, with an appropriate subject (e.g.,
   "Request for well-known URI: example").

   [[NOTE TO RFC-EDITOR: The name of the mailing list should be
   determined in consultation with the IESG and IANA.  Suggested name:
   wellknown-uri-review. ]]

   Before a period of 14 days has passed, the Designated Expert(s) will
   either approve or deny the registration request, communicating this
   decision both to the review list and to IANA.  Denials should include
   an explanation and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the
   request successful.

5.1.1.  Registration Template

   URI suffix:  The name requested for the well-known URI, relative to
      "/.well-known/"; e.g., "example".  MUST conform to the segment-nz
      production in [RFC3986].
   Change controller:  For standards-track RFCs, state "IETF".  For
      other open standards, give the name of the publishing body (e.g.,
      ANSI, ISO, ITU, W3C, etc.).  A postal address, home page URI,
      telephone and fax numbers may also be included.
   Specification document(s):  Reference to document that specifies the
      field, preferably including a URI that can be used to retrieve a
      copy of the document.  An indication of the relevant sections may
      also be included, but is not required.
   Related information:  Optionally, citations to additional documents
      containing further relevant information.

Appendix B.  Frequently Asked Questions

B.1.  Aren't well-known locations bad for the Web?

   They are, but for various reasons -- both technical and social --
   they are commonly used, and their use is increasing.  This memo
   defines a "sandbox" for them, to reduce the risks of collision and to
   minimise the impact upon pre-existing URIs on sites.

Internet-Draft          Defining Well-Known URIs           November 2009


B.2.  Why /.well-known?

   It's short, descriptive and according to search indices, not widely
   used.

B.3.  What impact does this have on existing mechanisms, such as P3P and
      robots.txt?

   None, until they choose to use this mechanism.

B.4.  Why aren't per-directory well-known locations defined?

   Allowing every URI path segment to have a well-known location (e.g.,
   "/images/.well-known/") would increase the risks of colliding with a
   pre-existing URI on a site, and generally these solutions are found
   not to scale well, because they're too "chatty".
