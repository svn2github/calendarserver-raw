"""
Object model for calendar data is as follows:

VCALENDAR
  VTIMEZONE*
  VEVENT* / VTODO* / VJOURNAL*
  BEGIN:X-CALENDARSERVER-PERUSER*
    X-CALENDARSERVER-PERUSER-UID
    UID
    BEGIN:X-CALENDARSERVER-PERINSTANCE
      RECURRENCE-ID?
      TRANSP?
      VALARM*

So we will store per user data inside the top-level component (alongside VEVENT, VTODO etc). That new component will
contain properties to identify the user and the UID of the VEVENT, VTODO it affects. It will contain sub-components
for each instance overridden by the per-user data. These per-user overridden components may not correspond to an
actual overridden component. In that situation the server has to re-construct the per-user data appropriately:

e.g., 

1. VEVENT contains an overridden instance, but X-CALENDARSERVER-PERUSER does not - server uses the must instance
X-CALENDARSERVER-PERUSER data (if any) for the overridden instance.

2. VEVENT does not contain an overridden instance, but X-CALENDARSERVER-PERUSER does - server synthesizes an
overridden instance to match the X-CALENDARSERVER-PERUSER one.

3. VEVENT contains overridden instance and X-CALENDARSERVER-PERUSER does - server merges X-CALENDARSERVER-PERUSER
data into overridden instance.
