L{twext.enterprise.queue} is an U{eventually consistent
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency>} task-queueing system for
use by applications with multiple front-end servers talking to a single
database instance, that want to defer and parallelize work that involves
storing the results of computation.

By enqueuing with L{twisted.enterprise.queue}, you may guarantee that the work
will I{eventually} be done, and reliably commit to doing it in the future, but
defer it if it does not need to be done I{now}.

To pick a hypothetical example, let's say that you have a store which wants to
issue a promotional coupon based on a customer loyalty program, in response to
an administrator clicking on a button.  Determining the list of customers to
send the coupon to is quick: a simple query will get you all their names.
However, analyzing each user's historical purchase data is (A) time consuming
and (B) relatively isolated, so it would be good to do that in parallel, and it
would also be acceptable to have that happen at a later time, outside the
critical path.

Such an application might be implemented with this queueing system like so::

    from twext.enterprise.queue import WorkItem, queueFromTransaction
    from twext.enterprise.dal.parseschema import addSQLToSchema
    from twext.enterprise.dal.syntax import SchemaSyntax

        create table PRODUCT (NAME varchar(255), ID integer primary key);
        create table PURCHASE (NAME varchar(255), WHEN timestamp,
                               CUSTOMER_ID integer references CUSTOMER,
                               PRODUCT_ID integer references PRODUCT;
        create table COUPON_WORK (WORK_ID integer primary key,
                                  CUSTOMER_ID integer references CUSTOMER);
        create table COUPON (ID integer primary key,
                            CUSTOMER_ID integer references customer,
                            AMOUNT integer);

class WorkItem(Record):
    """
    A L{WorkItem} is an item of work which may be stored in a database, then
    executed later.

    L{WorkItem} is an abstract class, since it is a L{Record} with no table
    associated via L{fromTable}.  Concrete subclasses must associate a specific
    table by inheriting like so::

        class MyWorkItem(WorkItem, fromTable(schema.MY_TABLE)):

    Concrete L{WorkItem}s should generally not be created directly; they are
    both created and thereby implicitly scheduled to be executed by calling
    L{enqueueWork <twext.enterprise.ienterprise.IQueuer.enqueueWork>} with the
    appropriate L{WorkItem} concrete subclass.  There are different queue
    implementations (L{PeerConnectionPool} and L{LocalQueuer}, for example), so
    the exact timing and location of the work execution may differ.

    L{WorkItem}s may be constrained in the ordering and timing of their
    execution, to control concurrency and for performance reasons repsectively.

    Although all the usual database mutual-exclusion rules apply to work
    executed in L{WorkItem.doWork}, implicit database row locking is not always
    the best way to manage concurrency.  They have some problems, including:

        - implicit locks are easy to accidentally acquire out of order, which
          can lead to deadlocks

        - implicit locks are easy to forget to acquire correctly - for example,
          any read operation which subsequently turns into a write operation
          must have been acquired with C{Select(..., ForUpdate=True)}, but it
          is difficult to consistently indicate that methods which abstract out
          read operations must pass this flag in certain cases and not others.

        - implicit locks are held until the transaction ends, which means that
          if expensive (long-running) queue operations share the same lock with
          cheap (short-running) queue operations or user interactions, the
          cheap operations all have to wait for the expensive ones to complete,
          but continue to consume whatever database resources they were using.

    In order to ameliorate these problems with potentiallly concurrent work
    that uses the same resources, L{WorkItem} provides a database-wide mutex
    that is automatically acquired at the beginning of the transaction and
    released at the end.  To use it, simply L{align
    <twext.enterprise.dal.record.Record.namingConvention>} the C{group}
    attribute on your L{WorkItem} subclass with a column holding a string
    (varchar).  L{WorkItem} subclasses with the same value for C{group} will
    not execute their C{doWork} methods concurrently.  Furthermore, if the lock
    cannot be quickly acquired, database resources associated with the
    transaction attempting it will be released, and the transaction rolled back
    until a future transaction I{can} can acquire it quickly.  If you do not
    want any limits to concurrency, simply leave it set to C{None}.

    In some applications it's possible to coalesce work together; to grab
    multiple L{WorkItem}s in one C{doWork} transaction.  All you need to do is
    to delete the rows which back other L{WorkItem}s from the database, and
    they won't be processed.  Using the C{group} attribute, you can easily
    prevent concurrency so that you can easily group these items together and
    remove them as a set (otherwise, other workers might be attempting to
    concurrently work on them and you'll get deletion errors).

    However, if doing more work at once is less expensive, and you want to
    avoid processing lots of individual rows in tiny transactions, you may also
    delay the execution of a L{WorkItem} by setting its C{notBefore} attribute.
    This must be backed by a database timestamp, so that processes which happen
    to be restarting and examining the work to be done in the database don't
    jump the gun and do it too early.

    @cvar workID: the unique identifier (primary key) for items of this type.
        On an instance of a concrete L{WorkItem} subclass, this attribute must
        be an integer; on the concrete L{WorkItem} subclass itself, this
        attribute must be a L{twext.enterprise.dal.syntax.ColumnSyntax}.  Note
        that this is automatically taken care of if you simply have a
        corresponding C{work_id} column in the associated L{fromTable} on your
        L{WorkItem} subclass.  This column must be unique, and it must be an
        integer.  In almost all cases, this column really ought to be filled
        out by a database-defined sequence; if not, you need some other
        mechanism for establishing a cluster-wide sequence.
    @type workID: L{int} on instance,
        L{twext.enterprise.dal.syntax.ColumnSyntax} on class.

    @cvar notBefore: the timestamp before which this item should I{not} be
        processed.  If unspecified, this should be the date and time of the
        creation of the L{WorkItem}.
    @type notBefore: L{datetime.datetime} on instance,
        L{twext.enterprise.dal.syntax.ColumnSyntax} on class.

    @ivar group: If not C{None}, a unique-to-the-database identifier for which
        only one L{WorkItem} will execute at a time.
